# Build a logistic regression model from scratch

I built a logistic regression class that has comparable performance to various scikit-learn classification models for binary classification on MNIST digits.

I implemented methods to calculate cross-entropy loss and perform gradient descent in order to fit the model to training data, and I also implemented methods to make probabilistic predictions on validation and test data.

I also implemented k-folds cross validation from scratch and used cross validation to tune the learning rate of my model.

I analyzed model performance by plotting decision boundaries, ROC curves, and PR curves.
